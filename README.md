# Async React Toolbox

> Tools to help show off - or fix - your async-mode React apps

This is an open source chrome extension you can toggle on or off to see whats going on with your laggy ass page. No affiliation with the React team. Currently this doesnt even require you to be a react user but in future we plan to add more reacty stuff so yeah i'm calling it a "react" toolbox.

This is completely open source: https://github.com/sw-yx/async-react-toolbox I am still a nooby chrome extension developer, please tell me if I am requesting too many permissions.

## Usage - chrome extension

The extension is [here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/fbchcodfbfjeededacomngobhnndcgol) - waiting for it to show up on the Chrome store. Then:

* install the extension.
* click the little browser icon
* you should see the radar appear
* now you can toggle it on or off using ctrl + R
* if you refresh your page or navigate away you'll need to click the icon to reactivate again (we try not to inject ourselves into every page, that would be douchey)
* also try dragging the box around
* enjoy tuning up your apps!

## Development

this is open source - and very rough right now. this repo doesnt ship with a demo but it could.
